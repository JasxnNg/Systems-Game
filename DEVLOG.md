2024-01-03 Started working on proposal
I added names of group members, our idea and how the user would use the program I worked on it with group members for roughly 30 minutes. At home I started on the technical details by determing which topics we were going to use for our project which took another 20 minutes.

2024-01-04 Finished proposal and began work on networking
I modified our intended project usage and topics we added because of the change in the type of game
we wanted. I worked on this with my group for 30 minutes. At home I copied over a bunch of the networking code from lab to be modified and added main to server and made sure that it worked properly which took 10 minutes. Then, I decided to make the server an array to hold all the connections and then put the connections into the array. This took 20 minutes with most of the time spent coming with the idea.

2025-01-05 Started work on a way to listen to multiple clients
Spent the 40 minutes at school working on the first itieration of the retrieveNumber function which was a copy of the select demo with some changes to fit the project. Then I created a struct to be used to hold both the guess and client metadata to be able to determine which client was communicating. At home, I fixed the struct and then added the struct to the function and fixed all the compiling issues which took 20 minutes.
