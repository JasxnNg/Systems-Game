# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Aareeb Jamil, Brian Chau, Jason Ng
       
# Intentions:

A rock paper scissor tournament of 12 players where the match log is recorded in a best of 1
    
# Intended usage:

A server hosts the main game with clients connecting to the server. The clients then type in either rock, paper or scissors and depending on the results, they move on, play again in a tie or the program exits. Then the winners of the game are rematched with each other until a winner of the whole tournament is decided.
